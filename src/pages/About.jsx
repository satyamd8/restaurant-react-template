          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to Diso's, an authentic American casual dining experience located at the heart of the <strong>Big Apple</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as two Italian brothers, making Italian subs from a street cart has now grown into a haven for the best classic American food with an Italian twist.
            <br />
            At Diso's, every single dish is hand-crafted with fresh, high-quality, and local produce, provided by our fellow New Yorkers.
            <br />
            We aim to be the standard American dining experience that everyone tries to be, one that brings people together from all over the world, enjoying the very best food.
